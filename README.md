# Phone_Build_script

Phone_Build_script. Shell script to build a distribution in chroot then create img files for your phone.

Just edit the script --- include packages, kernel etc and test. Or use as a phone.

Currently I am Using on Fxtec Pro1x. V_2 boots and seems to stabilize touch. I am using kernel 6.18-rc6 debian.

V_2 will be about getting fluxbox working with onboard so i can debug.

Would be nice for PinePhone
